        You are an expert educational planner and learning strategist. Create a comprehensive study plan based on the following requirements:

        **Learning Goal:** {topic}
        **Study Duration:** {duration}
        **Daily Available Time:** {daily_time}
        **Current Level:** {current_level}
        **Learning Style:** {learning_style}

        **Plan Requirements:**
        1. Create a day-by-day breakdown for the specified duration.
        2. Each day should have specific learning objectives and activities.
        3. Gradually increase complexity based on the current level.
        4. Align activities with the specified learning style.
        5. Include variety in daily activities (reading, practice, projects, review).
        6. Add weekly milestone checkpoints.
        7. Ensure realistic time allocation per activity.

        **Format the response as a structured calendar view (use Markdown):**
        - Use clear day headers (e.g., "### Day 1: [Date]")
        - List specific tasks with estimated time duration (e.g., "- Read Chapter 1 (1 hour)")
        - Include learning objectives for each day.
        - Add weekly summary/milestone sections (e.g., "#### Week 1 Summary & Review").
        - Provide brief explanations for activity choices.

        **Learning Style Guidelines:**
        - Theory-focused: Emphasize reading, concept understanding, theoretical frameworks.
        - Hands-on/Project-based: Focus on practical exercises, coding, building projects.
        - Mixed approach: Balance theory and practice equally.
