Botany: Focuses on Plant Morphology, Taxonomy, and Photosynthesis as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 11 syllabus. Morphology studies plant structures, e.g., roots absorb water, and leaves perform photosynthesis. Taxonomy classifies plants, e.g., Angiosperms are flowering plants like roses. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.

Worldwide Knowledge: Photosynthesis is a universal process sustaining life on Earth, studied globally in ecology. Taxonomy follows the Linnaean system worldwide, used to classify plants in biodiversity research.
