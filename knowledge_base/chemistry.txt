Chemistry: Covers Periodic Classification, Chemical Bonding, and Organic Chemistry as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 11 syllabus. The Periodic Table organizes elements by atomic number; for example, Group 1 elements (alkali metals) are highly reactive. Chemical bonds include ionic bonds (e.g., NaCl) and covalent bonds (e.g., H2O). Organic Chemistry studies carbon compounds, like hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, CH4).

Worldwide Knowledge: The Periodic Table, developed by Mendeleev, is a universal standard in chemistry, used globally in research and industry. Organic Chemistry principles are applied worldwide in pharmaceuticals, like synthesizing aspirin.
