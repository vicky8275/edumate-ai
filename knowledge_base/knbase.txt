Botany: Focuses on Plant Morphology, Taxonomy, and Photosynthesis as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 11 syllabus. Morphology studies plant structures, e.g., roots absorb water, and leaves perform photosynthesis. Taxonomy classifies plants, e.g., Angiosperms are flowering plants like roses. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2.

Worldwide Knowledge: Photosynthesis is a universal process sustaining life on Earth, studied globally in ecology. Taxonomy follows the Linnaean system worldwide, used to classify plants in biodiversity research.

Chemistry: Covers Periodic Classification, Chemical Bonding, and Organic Chemistry as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 11 syllabus. The Periodic Table organizes elements by atomic number; for example, Group 1 elements (alkali metals) are highly reactive. Chemical bonds include ionic bonds (e.g., NaCl) and covalent bonds (e.g., H2O). Organic Chemistry studies carbon compounds, like hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, CH4).

Worldwide Knowledge: The Periodic Table, developed by Mendeleev, is a universal standard in chemistry, used globally in research and industry. Organic Chemistry principles are applied worldwide in pharmaceuticals, like synthesizing aspirin.

Civics (Political Science): Focuses on Indian Constitution and Governance as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. The Indian Constitution, adopted in 1950, establishes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. Fundamental Rights include the Right to Equality (Article 14). The President of India is the head of state, while the Prime Minister leads the government.

Worldwide Knowledge: India’s Constitution draws from global models, like the U.S. Constitution’s judicial review and the U.K.’s parliamentary system. Concepts like democracy and secularism are universal, seen in nations like France (secularism) and the U.S. (democracy).

Computer Science and Technology: Covers Fundamentals of Computers, Programming, and Data Structures as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. A computer system consists of hardware (e.g., CPU, memory) and software (e.g., operating systems like Windows). Programming in Python includes basics like variables and loops, e.g., a for loop: for i in range(5): print(i) prints numbers 0 to 4. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures, e.g., a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort arranges numbers in order. Data Structures include arrays and lists, e.g., an array stores elements of the same type.

Worldwide Knowledge: Algorithms like Bubble Sort are foundational in global computing, used in software development. Python is a widely-used language globally, applied in AI and data science, e.g., TensorFlow for machine learning. Computer systems power modern technology, from smartphones to cloud computing platforms like AWS.

Economics: Covers Microeconomics and Macroeconomics as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. Microeconomics studies individual markets, e.g., the law of demand states that as price decreases, demand increases (e.g., more people buy rice when its price drops). Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, e.g., GDP measures a country’s total economic output, like India’s GDP growth rate.

Worldwide Knowledge: The law of demand is a universal principle, applied globally in market analysis (e.g., Apple pricing iPhones). GDP is a global metric, used by the World Bank to compare economies, like the U.S. versus China.

English Grammar: Focuses on parts of speech, tenses, and sentence structures as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi syllabus. For example, the active and passive voice involves changing the sentence structure, e.g., "She writes a letter" (active) becomes "A letter is written by her" (passive). Literature includes prose, poetry, and drama, such as "The Selfish Giant" by Oscar Wilde, which teaches moral values like kindness and generosity.

Worldwide Knowledge: English grammar rules are universal, but literature often reflects cultural contexts. For instance, Shakespeare's works, like "Macbeth," explore themes of ambition and guilt, which are studied globally and align with Tamil Nadu's focus on classic literature.

Geography: Covers Physical Geography and Human Geography as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. Physical Geography includes landforms, e.g., the Deccan Plateau in India is a volcanic plateau. Climate involves monsoon patterns, crucial for Tamil Nadu’s agriculture. Human Geography studies population distribution, e.g., Tamil Nadu has a high population density in urban areas like Chennai.

Worldwide Knowledge: Monsoon patterns are studied globally in meteorology, affecting agriculture in South Asia. Population studies align with global trends, like urbanization challenges seen in cities worldwide, such as Tokyo or New York.

History: Focuses on the Mughal Empire and Indian Freedom Struggle as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, ruled from 1628 to 1658. He commissioned the Taj Mahal, a white marble mausoleum in Agra, for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. The Indian Freedom Struggle began with the 1857 Revolt, also known as the First War of Independence. It gained momentum with leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, who led movements such as the Dandi Salt March in 1930 to protest British salt taxes.

Worldwide Knowledge: The Mughal Empire influenced global architecture, with the Taj Mahal being a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Indian Freedom Struggle inspired global independence movements, like South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela.

Mathematics: Covers Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. For example, differentiation is a process to find the rate of change, e.g., the derivative of x^2 is 2x. Integration is the reverse process, e.g., the integral of 2x is x^2 + C. Matrices in Linear Algebra involve operations like addition and multiplication, used in solving systems of equations.

Worldwide Knowledge: Calculus, developed by Newton and Leibniz, is a universal tool in engineering and physics, such as calculating planetary motion. Probability concepts, like the probability of an event P(E) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total outcomes), are used globally in statistics and data science.

Physics: Includes Mechanics, Thermodynamics, and Waves as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. Newton’s Second Law states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). Thermodynamics’ First Law is the law of energy conservation, stating that the change in internal energy equals heat added minus work done (ΔU = Q - W). Waves involve concepts like frequency and wavelength, where speed = frequency × wavelength.

Worldwide Knowledge: Newton’s laws are foundational in global physics, applied in everything from car safety to space travel (e.g., NASA’s rocket launches). Thermodynamics principles govern engines worldwide, like in car engines or power plants.

Zoology: Covers Human Physiology, Genetics, and Evolution as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. The human digestive system breaks down food, e.g., the stomach uses enzymes like pepsin to digest proteins. Genetics involves inheritance, e.g., Mendel’s laws explain how traits like eye color are passed on. Evolution, via natural selection, explains species development, e.g., Darwin’s finches adapted beak shapes to food sources.

Worldwide Knowledge: Mendel’s genetics laws are foundational globally, used in modern genetic engineering (e.g., GM crops). Darwin’s theory of evolution is a universal principle, applied in fields like anthropology and medicine.
