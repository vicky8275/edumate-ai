Economics: Covers Microeconomics and Macroeconomics as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. Microeconomics studies individual markets, e.g., the law of demand states that as price decreases, demand increases (e.g., more people buy rice when its price drops). Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, e.g., GDP measures a country’s total economic output, like India’s GDP growth rate.

Worldwide Knowledge: The law of demand is a universal principle, applied globally in market analysis (e.g., Apple pricing iPhones). GDP is a global metric, used by the World Bank to compare economies, like the U.S. versus China.
