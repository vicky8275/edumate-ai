Computer Science and Technology: Covers Fundamentals of Computers, Programming, and Data Structures as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. A computer system consists of hardware (e.g., CPU, memory) and software (e.g., operating systems like Windows). Programming in Python includes basics like variables and loops, e.g., a for loop: for i in range(5): print(i) prints numbers 0 to 4. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures, e.g., a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort arranges numbers in order. Data Structures include arrays and lists, e.g., an array stores elements of the same type.

Worldwide Knowledge: Algorithms like Bubble Sort are foundational in global computing, used in software development. Python is a widely-used language globally, applied in AI and data science, e.g., TensorFlow for machine learning. Computer systems power modern technology, from smartphones to cloud computing platforms like AWS.
