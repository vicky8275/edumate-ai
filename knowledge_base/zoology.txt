Zoology: Covers Human Physiology, Genetics, and Evolution as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi Class 12 syllabus. The human digestive system breaks down food, e.g., the stomach uses enzymes like pepsin to digest proteins. Genetics involves inheritance, e.g., Mendel’s laws explain how traits like eye color are passed on. Evolution, via natural selection, explains species development, e.g., Darwin’s finches adapted beak shapes to food sources.

Worldwide Knowledge: Mendel’s genetics laws are foundational globally, used in modern genetic engineering (e.g., GM crops). Darwin’s theory of evolution is a universal principle, applied in fields like anthropology and medicine.
