English Grammar: Focuses on parts of speech, tenses, and sentence structures as per Tamil Nadu Samacheer Kalvi syllabus. For example, the active and passive voice involves changing the sentence structure, e.g., "She writes a letter" (active) becomes "A letter is written by her" (passive). Literature includes prose, poetry, and drama, such as "The Selfish Giant" by Oscar Wilde, which teaches moral values like kindness and generosity.

Worldwide Knowledge: English grammar rules are universal, but literature often reflects cultural contexts. For instance, Shakespeare's works, like "Macbeth," explore themes of ambition and guilt, which are studied globally and align with Tamil Nadu's focus on classic literature.
